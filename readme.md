🧠 The 20-20-20 Rule

Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet (≈6 meters) away for 20 seconds.
This gives your eyes time to relax from continuous focusing on the screen and helps prevent digital eye strain.

💡 Eye Health Tips for Developers
🧍‍♂️ Follow 20-20-20 rule strictly.
Even a short break helps reduce eye fatigue.
🌤️ Ensure good ambient lighting.
Avoid working in a dark room with a bright monitor.
💻 Adjust screen brightness to match your environment.
🪞 Use proper screen distance — about 50-70 cm from your eyes.
🪑 Blink often.
Programmers blink up to 60% less — this dries your eyes.
💧 Stay hydrated and use artificial tears if needed.
🌿 Use blue-light filter or night mode especially at night.
😴 Get enough sleep.

Fatigue increases sensitivity and reduces focusing ability.
🕶️ Visit an eye specialist regularly.
Especially if you notice strain, blur, or headaches.
